## 2:03 PM `hasOwnProperty`

From MDN:
> Every object descended from `Object` inherits the `hasOwnProperty` method.
> This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified
> property as a direct property of that object; unlike the `in` operator, this
> method does not check down the object's prototype chain.

## Enter in vim

Never noticed before it's the equivalent of `j^`, not just `j`.
