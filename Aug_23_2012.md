jQuery join... is actually Array.join.

In vim `gql` is analogous to `gqap` - it formats the current line. Even better
- `gqq` formats the current line. Todo - learn more motions, I still don't
understand what the `ap` is in `gqap`.

Not sure if these will ever be useful... Vim insert mode commands:

    * <C-t> - adjust current line one indent right
    * <C-d> - adjust current line one indent left
    * <C-w> - backspace over a word (this one works in shell as well)
    * <C-u> - delete to beginning of indent
    * <C-u> - delete to beginning of indent
    * <C-o> - enter normal mode for one command then return to insert mode
        
        - `<C-o>ma` - mark the current position then keep typing
        - `<C-o>gql` - format the current line then keep typing

`fun.apply(thisArg[, argsArray])`
