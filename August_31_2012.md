## 10:50 AM - POST data

Apparently post data is usually encoded as form data rather than query strings.
I figured this out by observing the behavior of jQuery's `post` and `ajax`
(`ajax` will transparently switch between query strings and form data depending
on the request type.  It's simple to get form data in Flask when you're used to
getting query string data - just change the `args` to `form` in
`request.args.get("key")`.
