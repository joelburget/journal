Today I joined the CS team! I'm effectively taking over for intern Jamie Wong, who will be done with his internship on Friday. I've been starting to dig into the CS team's code. This is good stuff.

Learned today: underscore js's `pluck`: given a list of objects and a string (the key), extract a list of property values. Example:

    var players = [{name, 'Rafael Nadal', majors: 11},
                   {name, 'Roger Federer', majors: 17},
                   {name, 'Novak Djokovic', majors: 5}]
    _.pluck(players, 'majors')
    => [11, 17, 5]
