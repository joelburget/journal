## 2:14 PM - detaching and reattaching tmux

For when iterm gets messed up and doesn't show the cursor. Suspend - `C-b
:suspend-client`. Detaching might also work - `C-b d`. Then reattach - `tmux
attach`.

## 3:56 PM - `--no-edit`

Too lazy to edit your commit message on amend?

    amnd = commit --amend --no-edit

## 7:44 PM - `target` vs `currentTarget`

`event.target` is the lowest level node where the user clicked.
`event.currentTarget` is the node with the event listener.
