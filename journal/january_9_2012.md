## 5:20 PM - DOM levels

> DOM Levels are the versions of the specification for defining how the
> Document Object Model should work, similarly to how we have HTML4, HTML5, and
> CSS2.1 specifications.

> The most recent spec is DOM Level 3, published in April 2004.

> Additionally, there are pieces of the DOM spec that vendors can choose to
> implement, such as Core, HTML, and XML, as well as the event model. Depending
> on what is being built (a DOM parser, web browser layout engine, or
> javascript engine), the vendor may choose to implement some or all of the
> spec. Most modern web browsers implement all of the Level 3 spec.
