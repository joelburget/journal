## 6:54 PM - FPGAs

First of all, I [want an
FPGA](http://www.yosefk.com/blog/how-fpgas-work-and-why-youll-buy-one.html). I
wonder how well they would work as a dedicated functional programming machine -
for graph reduction and software defined IO. Apparently someone has already
[thought about this](/files/fpga.pdf).
