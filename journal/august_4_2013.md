## [The Idea Maze](http://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/)

It's all about "anticipating which turns lead to treasure and which lead to
certain death". Map out the maze through history, analogy, theories, and direct
experience.

## [I am not a number: I am a free variable](/files/notanum.pdf)

According to McBride and McKinna, you should use names for free variables and
de Bruijn indices for bound variables.

(I think) this is the approach used in the
[bound](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bound) library.
