## Capabilities and Coeffects

Interesting post (I only understand some of it) by Ben Lippmeier. The main part
that made sense to me was the coeffects section.

Effect typing says that running the computation will have some effects.
*Coeffect* typing says that a computation can only be run in a context with
certain capabilities.

Seems like a subtle distinction.
