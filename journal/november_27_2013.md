## [On Asm.js](http://acko.net/blog/on-asmjs/)

Acko argues that asm.js seems like a sweet hack at first but we should really
be aiming higher. We should really build a better language instead of
continuing to paste over it. Though this is an opinion I generally agree with,
this essay was a bit disjointed.

## [Error Function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function)

> function (non-elementary) of sigmoid shape

Also, `erfc` is the complementary error function and `erfi` is the imaginary
error function.
