## [SIGTERM vs SIGKILL](http://major.io/2010/03/18/sigterm-vs-sigkill/)

tldr - `SIGKILL` is more heavy-handed than `SIGTERM`. The process gets a chance
to react to `SIGTERM` but not `SIGKILL`, which goes straight to the init
process. `kill` vs `kill -9`. It's still possible to have zombie processes!
