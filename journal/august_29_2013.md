## `tabindex`

* If given a value of "-1", the element can't be tabbed to but focus can be
  given to the element programmatically (using element.focus()).
* If given a value of 0, the element can be focused via the keyboard and falls
  into the tabbing flow of the document.
* Values greater than 0 create a priority level with 1 being the most
  important.
