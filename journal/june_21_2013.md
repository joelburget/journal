## 7:22 AM - [F-Algebras](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2013/06/10/understanding-f-algebras/)

Interesting stuff, also talks about catamorphisms and initial algebras.

## 7:26 AM - Advanced Functional Programming

[This course](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/AdvancedFP/notes/index.html) looks amazing.
