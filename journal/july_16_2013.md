## Makefile automatic variables

* `$@` - the file name of the target of the rule
* `$%` - the target member name (whatever that means)
* `$<` - the name of the first prerequisite
* `$?` - the names of all prerequisites newer than the target
* `$^` - the names of all prerequisites

... and a few others

## Makefile `.PHONY`

- targets which are not files
