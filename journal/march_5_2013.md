## 4:06 PM - javascripts `arguments`

Typical javascript.

`arguments` is only a pseudo-array, it doesn't have any `Array` properties
other than `length`. You can convert it to an array with `var args =
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);`.

Clusterfuck review:
* `Array` is not really an array
* `arguments` is a bastardized `Array`
* The conversion is as easy and intuitive as `Array.prototype.slice.call`.
