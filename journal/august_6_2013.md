## Javascript function vs callable

Of course there's a [difference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/897103/what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-object-and-a-callable-object), why wouldn't there be?

A function is descended from the `Function` object, while a callable isn't
necessarily. Callables can be native I guess. Looks like little difference in
practice.
