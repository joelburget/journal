## Papers

I find myself looking at a lot of Conor McBride papers these days:

* [Kleisli arrows of outrageous fortune](/files/Kleisli.pdf)
* [Towards Observational Type Theory](/files/ott.pdf)
* [Dependently Typed Functional Programs and their Proofs
  (thesis)](/files/thesis.pdf)

I'm also looking at programming with effects and handlers:

* [Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers](/files/1203.1539v1.pdf)
* [Frank Slides](/files/mcbride-slides.pdf)
* [The Frank Manual](/files/TFM.pdf)
* [More Frank Slides](/files/fun.fk)
