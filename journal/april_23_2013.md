## 11:30 AM - Python metaclasses

Metaclass summary: They're used to intercept a class creation, modify the
class, and return the modified class.

> Everything is an object in Python, and they are all either instances of
> classes or instances of metaclasses.

> Except for type.

> type is actually its own metaclass. This is not something you could reproduce
> in pure Python, and is done by cheating a little bit at the implementation
> level.

class UpperAttrMetaclass(type):

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):

        attrs = ((name, value) for name, value in dct.items() if not name.startswith('__'))
        uppercase_attr = dict((name.upper(), value) for name, value in attrs)

        return super(UpperAttrMetaclass, cls).__new__(cls, name, bases, uppercase_attr)

* `cls` - the current instance
* `name` - the name of the class
* `bases` - parents of the class
* `dct` - attributes of the class
