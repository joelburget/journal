## `lerp` = linear interpolation

## 1:12 PM - discussion-meta, mod-controls, flag-controls, etc

dicussion-meta shows the following:
* badge icons if there are badges
* sum votes
* reply count / "Comment"
* mod or author or flagging controls
* date
* focus link if the item is not a scratchpad
* author link if not the item is not in a profile

author-controls shows the following:
* edit
* delete

flag-controls shows the following:
* "Flagged" or "Flag"

mod-controls shows the following:
* number of flags or ("Approve" if in mod queue)
* skip if in mod queue
* change type if the item is not a scratchpad
* edit if the item is not a scratchpad
* delete or undelete

*All* of that eventually arises from discussion-meta.
