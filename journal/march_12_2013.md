## 5:55 PM - `SIGINT`, `SIGSTP`, `SIGSTOP`

> ctrl-c sends the `SIGINT` signal, the default behavior of which is to
> terminate the process.

> ctrl-z sends the `SIGTSTP` signal, the default behavior of which is to pause
> the process. Paused processes are not scheduled until they are resumed via
> the `SIGCONT` signal. `SIGTSTP` is the same as `SIGSTOP` except the latter
> cannot be ignored or handled.

> `SIGINT` is used to gracefully shutdown processes. `SIGSTOP` is used to
> implement job control.
