## [GHC API examples](http://parenz.wordpress.com/2013/08/17/ghc-api-interpreted-compiled-and-package-modules/)

## Different types of data

* Concrete data type - <strike>a type whose representation is visible</strike>
  a data type with no parameters
* Abstract data type - a type with associated operations whose representation
  is hidden. "parametrized types can be viewed as a kind of abstract type,
  because they leave some parts of the data type undefined, or abstract"
* Positive vs Negative - "Noam Zeilberger has developed an elegant theory of
  eager and lazy types based on distinguishing positive from negative
  polarities of type constructors, the positive including the inductive and the
  negative including the coinductive." (?)
  - A positive type is defined by its membership conditions (constructors),
    e.g. list. Positive types are colimits - we know as part of their semantics
    how a value is constructed.
  - A negative type is defined by its behavioral conditions (destructors), e.g.
    stream. Negative types are limits - we know as part of their semantics how
    they behave when destructed.

## Strict vs Lazy

An interesting gripe with strict languages I haven't seen before - [you need to write bespoke recursion rather than reusing combinators](http://augustss.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-points-for-lazy-evaluation-in.html).
