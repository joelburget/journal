## Brian McKenna Stuff

* [Bottom-up Type Annotation with the Cofree Comonad](http://brianmckenna.org/blog/type_annotation_cofree)
  - This seems like a solid approach to typing, I like it a lot. Some ways I would like to improve it:
    * Typing rules that look like typing rules, not code
    * I think there are a few places it could be improved with laziness
  - I need to learn about cofree
* [Read-only Guest tmux Sessions](http://brianmckenna.org/blog/guest_tmux)
  - Sweet - gonna have to try this out. Not convinced it's secure.
* [OSXMonad as an XMonad library](http://brianmckenna.org/blog/osxmonad_library)
  - He did what I failed to do

## [Inferring Typing Derivations for the STLC in Haskell](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2013-04-13-inferring-evidence-for-the-stlc-in-haskell.html)

Interesting article - he makes the compiler do most of the work for him and
uses tricky sugar to elegantly present the typing rules. Unfortunately I think
this approach is only useful for embedded languages.
