## 11:11 AM

I spent a lot of the morning taking care of things - gym -> insurance agency -> mechanic -> set up internet.

Now that I got all that done I've been reading about promises in javascript. I think they might be useful for the autocomplete code I've been working on. The file with the autocomplete data is rather large so I would like to have a backup plan for if it hasn't downloaded yet - we could just send a request to have the server do the work.
