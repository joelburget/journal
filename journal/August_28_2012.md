## 1:56 PM - command line formatting json

    cat my.json | python -mjson.tool

## 2:00 PM - `python -m`

Apparently `python -m` is like importing a module, so `python -m foo` is like
saying `import foo`, except presumably module foo will have `if __name__ ==
'__main__'` somewhere.

## 2:45 PM

Having daymares about the search page.

## 9:18 PM - backbone articles

`render` should be idempotent.
Don't just render with `$el.html()` - breaks by unbinding events.

    render : function () {
        this.$el.html(this.template(options));
        return this;
    }

You must re-call `setElement` on subviews:

    render : function () {
        this.$el.$html(this.template());

        this.subview.setElement(this.$('.subview')).render();
        this.anotherSubview.setElement(this.$('.another-subview')).render();
        return this;
    }

Nicer:
    
    assign : function (view, selector) {
        view.setElement(this.$(selector)).render();
    }

    render : function () {
        this.$el.html(this.template());

        this.assign(this.subview,        '.subview');
        this.assign(this.anotherSubview, '.another-subview');
        return this;
    }

jashkenas - don't do all that work, don't re-render the subviews, only the part
of the main view that has changed.

###3 http://ianstormtaylor.com/break-apart-your-backbonejs-render-methods/

Basically, just break up your render method... Took a lot of words to say that.
The non-obvious thing to me, not having written any backbone before, is that
you can inherit the helpers.
