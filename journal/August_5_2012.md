At the Santa Clara public library, learning about quantum mechanics. Reading about the [many-worlds interpretation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) as in Anathem. I'm also going to read [this article](http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html) before continuing with my more formal Coursera course.

Most of the Scott Aronson article flew right over my head, but the beginning did make sense - the explanation of adding in negative probabilities and why that leads to quantum weirdness. I'm surprised the wikipedia article described the many-worlds interpretation as being mainstream along with the Copenhagen interpretation - the one I've always heard. That said, they both seem to explain quantum mechanics equally well, thus by Occam's Razor should accept the simpler explanation - MWI.
