  recurrences
* [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) fuzzy string comparison
* [watchdog](http://packages.python.org/watchdog/) monitor file system events
* [sh](http://amoffat.github.com/sh/) call programs as functions
* [pattern](https://github.com/clips/pattern) data mining, natural language
  processing, machine learning, network analysis.
* [path.py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py) easy paths
