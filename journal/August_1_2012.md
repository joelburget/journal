## 10:20 AM
Got to work, cleared some emails and began looking into an unexpected failure from yesterday's deploy related to this [App Engine issue](http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6820)

## 10:55 AM
Attempting to install [Hbro](https://github.com/k0ral/hbro) in a VM, for kicks. It failed last night but I doubled the VM's memory today to 1GB.

## 11:18 AM
Gtk has finally built on the VM...

## 3:00 PM
Had lunch then talked with Tom about fixing the error. Then dev standup and John talked to me afterwards about joining the CS team after search and autocomplete raps up. At 3:30 is the company update. I would also like to lease an apartment today and I have to pick up my car before 5:00.

The company update was pretty good. I demoed (very quickly) that you can now search for exercises as well as the new look of the search page (thanks to Jason). There were also demos from Ankit (people helping people) and someone elseâ€¦ We then had a lengthy and heated discussion and it was getting to be 4:30 when Ester and Ben sang a well rehearsed birthday song for June and July (I think) birthdays. I had to run out so I could pick up my car from the body shop before 5 and then I attempted to go to the apartment complex so I could sign a lease. The leasing office was empty though, so I gave up for the day. After I got back I had some pie that was left from after the company update and talked to Tom who had fixed our App Engine problem. Looks like we were trying to store something too large for the datastore so we had to chunk it up. It was frustrating that the error message was both different than what you get on the dev server and not at all helpful. I managed to get just a bit more work done before Jeff, intern from last summer, now working at Apple, showed up for game night. It was a blast. We had an amazing game of *The Resistance*.
