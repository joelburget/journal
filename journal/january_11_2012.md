## 10:12 AM - Mercurial `default`

This is really basic but I always forget, the name of the current branch in
Mercurial is `default`.

## 1:51 PM - pdb in IPython

Use `%pdb` then IPython will start the debugger on any uncaught exception.

## 2:57 PM - Python `__str__` and `__repr__`

Just a reminder - use "%s" and "%r" respectively.

Also, Python containers use `__repr__` for their contained objects.

## 6:06 PM - When rpcs are made

An ndb `Future` "represents a promise that an RPC will be made at some point in
the future, typically when the event loop runs out of immediately runnable
tasklets."
