## Free Monads

[Good intuition](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13388966/383958) that "a free monad
satisfies all the Monad laws, but does not do any collapsing (i.e.,
computation). It just builds up a nested series of contexts." A free monoid
does something similar where the contexts aren't nested but it just holds a
list of items rather than meaningfully joining them.

I still can't figure out what a cofree comonad is.
