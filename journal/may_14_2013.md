## 10:03 AM - double dropbox

I created two dropbox folders, `~/Dropbox-personal`, and `~/Dropbox-work`.
Start the dropbox clients with:

    HOME=$HOME/Dropbox-personal /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &
    HOME=$HOME/Dropbox-work /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &

Will have to see what happens when I restart.
