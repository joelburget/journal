## 10:31 PM - Lambda Diagrams

http://binarylambda.blogspot.com/2013/03/lambda-diagrams-lambda-diagrams-few.html

> Lambda Diagrams are a graphical notation for closed lambda terms, in which
> abstractions (lambdas) are represented by horizontal lines, variables by
> vertical lines emanating down from their binding lambda, and applications by
> horizontal links connecting the leftmost variables and extending the leftmost
> one down. In the alternative style, the final extension is omitted, and
> applications link the nearest deepest variables, for a more stylistic, if
> less uniform, look.
