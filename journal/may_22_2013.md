> Kan Extensions for Program Optimisation
> Or: Art and Dan Explain an Old Trick

I'm most interested in this for the great diagrams and cat theory.

## 8:53 PM - [The pitfalls of verifying floating point computations](/files/floatingpoint.pdf)

> We shall discuss the following myths, among others:
> • “Since C’s float (resp. double) type is mapped to IEEE single (resp.
>   double) precision arithmetic, arithmetic operations have a uniquely de-
>   ﬁned meaning across platforms.”
> • “Arithmetic operations are deterministic; that is, if I do z=x+y in two
>   places in the same program and my program never touches x and y in the
>   meantime, then the results should be the same.”
> • A variant: “If x < 1 tests true at one point, then x < 1 stays true later
>   if I never modify x.”
> • “The same program, strictly compliant with the C standard with no “undeﬁned
>   behaviours”, should yield identical results if compiled on the same
>   IEEE-compliant platform by diﬀerent compliant compilers.”

Really cool, especially the nondeterminism. Plus a good floating point
reference. I really should read this.
