## `git reset` vs `checkout`

> In their simplest form, reset resets the index without touching the working
> tree, while checkout changes the working tree without touching the index.

> `checkout` is usually used with a branch, tag or commit. In this case it will
> reset `HEAD` and the index to the given commit as well as performing the
> checkout of the index into the working tree.

> Also, if you supply `--hard` to `reset` you can ask `reset` to overwrite the
> working tree as well as resetting the index.

> If you current have a branch checked out out there is a crucial different
> between `reset` and checkout when you supply an alternative branch or commit.
> `reset` will change the current branch to point at the selected commit
> whereas checkout will leave the current branch alone but will `checkout` the
> supplied branch or commit instead.

Using ansible to sign into my server:

    > ssh-agent bash
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    $ ansible -i ~/ansible_hosts all -m ping

Paramiko for some reason causes ansible to think the server is down.

When I change the `sshd_config`, I will have to change my `ansible_hosts` file
to include `ansible_ssh_port=2222`.
