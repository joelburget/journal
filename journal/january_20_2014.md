## `const` in javascript

Today marks the first time I've actually seen `const` in javascript code. Looks
like you can use it in most browsers, even IE 11.

The semantics is going to change a bit in ES 6 so `const` variables will be
block scoped.

on opetopic diagrams. These are pretty interesting. I wonder how well they
would work for program exploration and development or if they're too purely
categorical. I'm guessing these fall too far on the side of a mathematical
curiosity.
