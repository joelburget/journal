## 9:38 PM - functional encryption

> We initiate the formal study of functional encryption by giving precise
> definitions of the concept and its security. Roughly speaking, functional
> encryption supports restricted secret keys that enable a key holder to learn
> a specific function of encrypted data, but learn nothing else about the data.
> For example, given an encrypted program the secret key may enable the key
> holder to learn the output of the program on a specific input without
> learning anything else about the program.

> Quite notably, functional encryption generalizes many existing encryption
> schemes, including public-key encryption, identity-based encryption and
> homomorphic encryption.
