I spent a lot of my morning looking at a possible bug in recording a user's video watching as well as a related performance problem - we didn't find any real answers but at least it's on his radar.

Currently going back down the rabbit hole of autocomplete - looking at using the following scheme:

We should match on the beginnings of words a user types - so for instance we can match "o chem" -> "organic chemistry" and "diff eq" -> "differential equations". It's debatable if this is truly the best way but it's what I'll be working with for now.

Thus it's possible to use a lookup structure that holds only words but allows us to reconstruct a title. For the main lookup a trie may be the best choice as it's very fast. The problem then is reconstructing titles from individual words. Say a user types in "chemistry" which will be a completed word, so it will have associated information - namely a way of looking up the other titles.

To be completed...

Git commands I learned today:

  - `git hash-object`: generate a hash of a file: `git hash-object foo.txt`
  - `git cat-file`: `cat` for git blobs (or other git objects? What are there besides blobs and trees? (update: commits)):
    
    $ git hash-object foo.txt
    <hash>
    $ git cat-file -t <hash>
    blob
    $ git cat-file blob <hash>
    <file contenxt>
  - `git ls-tree`: `ls` for git trees:

    $ git ls-tree HEAD
    <perms> <type> <hash> <filename>

  - `git rev-parse`: find the commit HEAD references, and something else. This command has less than ideal docs, "git-rev-parse - Pick out and massage parameters", "Many git porcelainish commands take mixture of flags"...

    $ git rev-parse HEAD
    <hash>

"A blob represents the fundamental data unit in Git. Really, the whole system is about blob management."
