[Using the continuation monad to make nested code / callbacks more pleasant](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/s49kk/using_contt_to_please_the_eye/)

Just got in - one thing I forgot to include yesterday is I finally learned how the css pseudo-elements `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:before`, and `:after` work. I was under the mistaken impression that `<elem>:{first,last}-child` would match the {first,last} child of `<elem>`, when what it really does it matches `<elem>` if it is a {first,last} child itself. Similarly with `:first-{line,letter}`. Also, `:before` and `:after` insert their content before/after the content of the element - but inside of it.

Two extra notes:

    - One or two colons apparently does the same thing, the difference is that one colon indicates a pseudo-class, while two indicates a pseudo-element. I'm not yet clear on the difference.

    - A pseudo-element must have a `content`, even if it's just an empty string.

I forgot to mention in my earlier entry, to do what I had been trying to do, grab the first child of an element, just insert a ' > ', i.e. `#timeline-events:first-child` -> `#timeline-events > :first-child`.

Autoomplete v1 is ready to ship (hopefully).

Git commands reminded of today:

  - `git cherry-pick`: Apply a set of changesets to HEAD. I was trying to use `rebase` instead of this and it was pulling in other changes I didn't want… which makes sense.

Clever bit of Haskell code I just [discovered](http://hpaste.org/72953)

Original

    createShaders :: IO (Shader, Shader)
    createShaders = do
        vertex <- glCreateShader gl_VERTEX_SHADER
        e <- checkError
        case e of
            [] -> do
                fragment <- glCreateShader gl_FRAGMENT_SHADER
                e <- checkError 
                case e of
                    [] -> pure (Shader vertex, Shader fragment)
                    _  -> fail $ formattedErrorCodes e
            _  -> fail $ formattedErrorCodes e

Now Use the `EitherT` monad transformer

    checkError :: EitherT Error IO ()

    createShaders :: EitherT Error IO (Shader, Shader)
    createShaders = do
        vertex <- liftIO (glCreateShader gl_VERTEX_SHADER) <* checkError
        fragment <- liftIO (glCreateShader gl_FRAGMENT_SHADER) <* checkError
        pure (Shader vertex, Shader fragment)
        
Short explanation - the value comes from the calls wrapped in liftIO while the computation may be aborted by the `checkError`s, whose values are ignored. This really shows off the advantage of Haskell's abstraction.
