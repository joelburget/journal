## 9:42 AM - dvorak
I'm typing on a dvorak keyboard today... Every character is painful, it's
really difficult to think in code rather than individual characters.

## 5:08 PM - dvorak vs ex mode First of all, typing in dvorak all day has been
absolutely exhausting. According to this [SO
question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1269689/to-disable-entering-ex-mode-in-vim)
it's common to trigger vim's ex mode with dvorak - I can confirm that is the
case.
