## 12:12 PM - vim backreferences

    :%s/\(.*\){$/#journal_entry \1 {/g

Used to insert `#journal_entry` before all the css rules in a file - note that
you must backwhack the parens to capture.

## 12:15 PM - scrolling in tmux

<C-o> [ , for scroll mode, which allows vim movements, like j / k, <C-u> /
<C-d>, <C-y> / <C-e>, <C-b> / <C-f>!
