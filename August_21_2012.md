## 6:28 AM

Early morning after taking my sister to the airport and a workout. I'm feeling good considering the amount of sleep I got.

Git commands learned so far today:

`whatchanged`: list what files have changed in your repository, e.g. `git whatchanged --since="6 hours ago"`

Khan Academy dotfiles mercurial log commands:

command | result
------- | ------
`slog`  | revision number + commit message
`nlog`  | changeset + author + date + summary + modified files
`sglog` | revision number + commit message, graphical
`gslog` | = `sglog`
`lga`   | revision number + author, + commit message + time authored, graphical
`lg`    | = `lga`, but only shows history of current revision
`dlog`  | revision number + commit message

I'll figure out the difference between `slog` and `dlog`, etc when I start using bookmarks.

[Mercurial revsets](http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/revsets) - selecting a set of revisions

â€¦ and the [corresponding information for git](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitrevisions.html)

Git commands learned today:

* `rev-parse`: I've listed this before but I'm still gaining an understanding of it. Looks like it takes flags used to name commits and parses them to put them in a nice, standard format used for other commands.
* `rev-list <commits>`: Lists commits reachable from the commits in `<commits>`, but not reachable from those prepended by `^`. Returned in reverse chronological order.
