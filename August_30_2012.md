## 4:08 PM - underscore's `chain`

First, you can call `chain` in the "object oriented" style -
`_(stooges).chain()`, which is not entirely obvious.

The example from the website is

    var stooges = [{name : 'curly', age : 25}, {name : 'moe', age : 21}, {name : 'larry', age : 23}];
    var youngest = _.chain(stooges)
      .sortBy(function(stooge){ return stooge.age; })
      .map(function(stooge){ return stooge.name + ' is ' + stooge.age; })
      .first()
      .value();
    => "moe is 21"

... which makes sense, but it's not clear to me why you can't do this without
`chain` - types would help a lot here.

    var stooges = [{name : 'curly', age : 25}, {name : 'moe', age : 21}, {name : 'larry', age : 23}];

    _(stooges).sortBy(function(stooge){ return stooge.age; })
    => [Object, Object, Object]

    _(stooges)
        .sortBy(function(stooge){ return stooge.age; })
        .map(function(stooge){ return stooge.name + ' is ' + stooge.age;})
    => ["moe is 21", "larry is 23", "curly is 25"]

At this point I'm thoroughly confused why this is working without chain. But
then,

    _(stooges)
        .sortBy(function(stooge){ return stooge.age; })
        .map(function(stooge){ return stooge.name + ' is ' + stooge.age;})
        .first()
    => TypeError: Object moe is 21,larry is 23,curly is 25 has no method 'first'

Okay, so it really does do something. What's not clear to me is why `map` works
with a non-chained array, but `first` doesn't.

PS - `chain` returns a `wrapper` object and all the other links in the chain
return one as well.

## 4:31 PM - underscore's `reject`

the opposite of filter.
