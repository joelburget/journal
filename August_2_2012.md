Just got into work after working out then looking at several apartments this morning. After lunch I plant to go and reserve one after picking up my checkbook. The problem is I don't know which one I'm going with yet. I hate getting in to work this late, so ready for the apartment search to be over.

Looks like the whole morning will have been taken up trying to get my dev environment working again. I installed Mountain Lion last night right before going to bed and htis morning none of the commands I usually rely on work. I had installed the new version of Xcode, but I need to install the command line tools and reinstall things that were broken. Ugh. [This guide](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/27985816073/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-riding-a-mountain-lion) is helpful.

Finally got some real work done. I spent the time after lunch from about 12:45 to 2:30 running around trying to finally lease a place. I finally decided on Avalon Creekside after I looked up the other place I visited this afternoon on Yelp, where it got horrible reviews. I was that close to renting from them. I haven't even actually seen the inside of one of the Avalon apartments, but I'm desperate for a place and I had to just make a decision. It's very close to the office so I'm glad about that but I'm not sure how nice it is. Oh well, I'm committed now. I visited six or seven places just today.
