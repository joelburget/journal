### Referencing commits:

`name^`: the parent of `name`
`name^^`: the parent of the parent of `name`
`name^2`: same as the previous example
`name~10`: the 10th ancestor of `name`. How does this differ from the caret syntax? Commonly used with `rebase -i`
`name:path`: a file within a commit's content tree
`name1..name2`: All commits from name1 back to, but not including, name2. Remember, name2 is the older one. HEAD is used in the place of one that's omitted. Yes, that can be useful, after a `fetch`.
`name1...name2`: For `log` this lists all commits referenced by name1 xor name2 - i.e. the unique commits in both branches. For diff the range is between name2 and the common ancestor of name1 and name2 - changes introduced by name1 are not shown.
`--since="2 weeks ago"`, `--until="1 week ago"`
`--grep=pattern`, `--committer=pattern`, `--author=pattern`: These are self explanatory, note grep searches the commit message.
`--no-merges`: all commits in the range that have only one parent, i.e. are not merges
